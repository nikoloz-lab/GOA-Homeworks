<!--Explain what CSS is and how it is used via comments*-->
<!--
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the presentation (style) of an HTML document. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual design of the webpage.
CSS can be applied to HTML in three ways:
1. Inline - directly within an HTML element using the "style" attribute.
2. Internal - within a <style> tag in the <head> section of the HTML file.
3. External - using an external stylesheet file linked with <link> in the HTML document.
