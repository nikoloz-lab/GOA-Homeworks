<!--Explain what a value and property are via comments*-->
<!--
In CSS, a property is a style feature you want to change, such as color, font-size, or margin.
A value is what you assign to a property, such as red, 20px, or 10px.
Example:
p {
color: red; /* Property: color, Value: red */
font-size: 16px; /* Property: font-size, Value: 16px */
}
