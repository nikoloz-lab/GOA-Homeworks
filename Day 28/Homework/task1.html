<!--
Internal CSS: This type of CSS is written within the <style> tag inside the <head> section of an HTML document. It allows you to style multiple elements on a single webpage without affecting other pages.

Example of internal CSS:
<head>
<style>
p {
color: blue;
}
</style>
</head>

Inline CSS: This is used to apply styles directly to an HTML element using the "style" attribute. It is useful for quick, one-time changes but can make your HTML code harder to manage if overused.

Example of inline CSS:
<p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">This is an example of inline CSS.</p>
